# PSEUDO EXERCISE

Use pseudocode to program the canvas, according to the following requirements:

- There must be at least 5 frames
- Framerate should not exceed 30 FPS
- 


### Instruction examples:

```
config fps 1            // set the framerate

clear all               // clear entire canvas
set x 0                 // set the x variable to 0
set y 0
set width 50%           // set the width variable to 100% of canvas width
set height 50%
paint selection red     // paint the selected area red

set x 50%
set y 50%
set width 50%
set height 50%
paint selection orange

new frame               // create a new frame
clear all
set size 50%, 50%       // set width to 50% and height to 50%
set position 25%, 25%   // set x to 25% and y to 25%
clear selection         // clear the selected area

set x 25%
set y 25%
set width 50%
set height 50%
outline selection red   // outline selected area in red

new frame x
